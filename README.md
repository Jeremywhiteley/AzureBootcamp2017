# AzureBootcamp2017
Files used in the Azure Bootcamp presentation (Los Angeles, CA).

This presentation focused on building an Angular (4) app with an Azure DocumentDB database, accessed via a .Net Core 1.1 WebApi.

## GolfTracker
This is a fairly complex Angular app that can track the scores for golfers.  It's a full CRUD application and demonstrates how to perform fine grain CRUD operations even to deeply nested DocumentDB JSON documents.
